<*** The Salient Features ***>

### The Salient Features <a name="Salient-Features"></a>
** The software can exhibit a menu comprising various items sourced from a JSON file. An added advantage is that modifying the JSON file suffices to update both the menu and the entire order-taking process in subsequent runs.
** Users can select their desired items for ordering simply by entering the corresponding food item names. Any invalid entries or spelling errors in an order will prompt the user to make corrections.
** Upon a valid order, an Order object will be generated, initiating a sequence involving calorie and price calculations. Subsequently, the total calories and price will be presented to the user.
*** Orders exceeding a total calorie count of 3000 will be declined.
